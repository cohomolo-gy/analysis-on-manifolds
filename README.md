# Differential Geometry Problem Sets

This project is for problem sets from the following books: 

1. Analysis on Manifolds - Munkres
2. Calculus on Manifolds - Spivak
3. Differential Topology - Guillemin and Pollack
4. Differential Forms in Algebraic Topology - Bott & Tu

This is an ongoing project to review my calculus for the GRE Subject Matter Test. Why? Because go big or go home.
